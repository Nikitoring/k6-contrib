# BigInt

A bigInt field represents an bigint value, that represented in GraphQL as string.

## Usage

This package isn't included with the keystone fields package and needs to be installed with `yarn add @keystonejs-contrib-next/fields-bigint` or `npm install @keystonejs-contrib-next/fields-bigint`

Then import it, and use it like any other field:

```js
const { bigInt } = require('@keystonejs/fields-bigint');
```
